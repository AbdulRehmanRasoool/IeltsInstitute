              <p>I attended Miss Seema's Academy for general IELTS. She explained about each of the 4 modules of IELTS in detail along with the tips and tricks to solve each type of question in each module. I had practiced some material before joining her program, but I observed that my scores in practice tests increased after attending the classes and applying her techniques to solve the questions.

              <p>I was advised by my friend to study under the guidance of Ms. Seema  and I found this experience worth while. Apart from my band score of 7.5 that I conveniently earned, I learned a lot about critically evaluating myself in writing speaking and reading. My gratitude for the way she helped improve my band score. I advise others to prepare themselves for IELTS likewise with trained instructors like Miss. Seema.

              <p>My IELTS trainer was Miss Seema . It was a terrific experience getting trained by her. Not only does she emphasize on the minor details of the exam but also gives assignments and mock tests to check the students’ progress in each component. Her diligent efforts and support enabled me to acquire a good result in the actual exam. Thank you Miss seema.

              <p>To pass an IELTS exam with a desired score is always challenging. I was able to score 7.0. this achievement was the result of extensive study and Ms. Seema’s right guidance. I believe hard work always pays off and that belief was given to me by Ms. Seema. She provided me with useful techniques and tips on how to tackle the difficulty of this exam. I believe these tips were the reason I was able to achieve 7.0 band.
